# Sirs-Web-Portfolio
A web portfolio that i worked on
# HTML:
HTML was the stepping stone of my website and I planned all the sections and parts in HTML to keep CSS simple. 
I linked google fonts and CSS style sheet to HTML so I can use font for better look and feel.


# CSS:
CSS was made simple by HTML. I kept picking one by one classes and attributes and keep styling as we go. And things started shaping up nicely. I knew I am going to differenciate CSS by section, Navbar, Header, Work sample and footer. So it was much easier to target. 


# Responsiveness and Media Queries:

 I wanted  to make the website interactive and responsive. So I tried adding added media queries at for breaking point of 1000px and 500px to make it compatible with all screen size and devices.


# Techenologies:
This project was built with HTML and CSS.


## Deploy:
I deploy this website by using GitHub commands (Git Clone, git add., git push). And shared a live link for review.
